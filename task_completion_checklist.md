# Task Completion Checklist

After you think you're done with a task, please check off the following items.

## 1. Code Quality
- [ ] Think hard again about the code you wrote. Does it solve the problem? Are there any missed edge cases? Perhaps something can be improved?
- [ ] Verify no new compiler warnings are introduced.

## 2. Testing
- [ ] Ensure that the new functionality is tested.
- [ ] Run tests to ensure all tests pass - first new and affected tests, then all tests.

## 3. Docker Verification (if applicable)
- [ ] Test that Docker image builds successfully (`docker compose build`)

## 4. Documentation
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md file if required.
- [ ] Update memories or create new ones if you learned something new which may be useful for future tasks.
- [ ] Update other relevant .md files if required.
